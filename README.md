# Assign On Solve App

## Description:

:no_entry: THIS APP IS UN-TESTABLE AND UN-USABLE IN PRODUCTION :no_entry: 

The reason why is that Zendesk has since added client side validation, making it impossible to submit a ticket without a requester already. Therefore this App is only here for demonstration purposes on how to use the Save Hook. 

This is the Assign On Solve for Zendesk. The app will assign the ticket to the user setting the status to Solved __if__ that ticket is unassigned at the time of the submission. Pull requests are welcome.

## App location:

* Ticket sidebar

## Features:

* Assigns it to currentUser if ticket is solved without assignee
* uses Save Hook

## Set-up/installation instructions:

No set up required. It just "works". well not really. See the "description" section.

## Contribution:

Pull requests are welcome.

## Screenshot(s):

See description section as to why no screenshot is available
